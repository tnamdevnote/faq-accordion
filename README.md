## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

#### Accessibility Rule #1: Use appropriate semantic HTML<br>
Keyboard support is important aspects of building an accessibility, especially with interactive components like Accordion. To support expand/collapse behavior with keyboard, we have to use `<button>` element to handle `onClick` events. This is not only semantically appropriate, but also it offers other perks, such as being able to focus on element with a `tab` key or using `disabled` attribute. We would lose these features if we were to use non semantic HTML, such as `<div>`.

```jsx
// Bad
<div
  onClick={handleClick}
>
  Accordion Header with Accessibility Feature
  <span>{isOpen ? <IconMinus /> : <IconPlus />}</span>
</div>

// Good
<h2>
  <button
    onClick={handleClick}
  >
    Accordion Header with Accessibility Feature
    <span>{isOpen ? <IconMinus /> : <IconPlus />}</span>
  </button>
</h2>
```

#### Accessibility Rule #2: Indicate state of accordion `aria-expanded`<br>
Besides adding a keyboard support, another way to improve accessibility on Accordion is by indicating if the control is expanded or not. We can achieve this by adding `aria-expanded` attributes to the `<button>` element.

```jsx
<h2>
  <button
    aria-label={isExpanded} // isExpanded resolves to boolean values.
    onClick={handleClick}
  >
    Accordion Header with Accessibility Feature
    <span>{isOpen ? <IconMinus /> : <IconPlus />}</span>
  </button>
</h2>
```

When we take a look at the accessibility tree in the above image, we can see that `expanded` property is set to true as the second accordion comes into focus with tab key. This allows screen readers to detect the current state of the component, allowing visually impaired people to navigate through the content much easier.<br>

#### Accessibility Rule #3: Linking the panel with the header: `aria-labelledby` and `role`<br>

#### Accessibility Rule #4: Naming the control: `aria-controls` <br>
